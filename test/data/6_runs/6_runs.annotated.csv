Here we study the relationship between the                 gut metagenomes of dogs, humans, mice, and pigs. By building a                 gene catalog (containing 1,247,405 genes) we show that the dog                 microbiome is closer to the human microbiome than the pig or                 mice microbiomes in gene content. We further demonstrate the                 similarity of the dog microbiome to the human one with a                 randomized trial of two diets (high-protein/low-carbohydrate                 vs. lower-protein/higher-carbohydrate). Diet has a large,                 reproducible, effect on the microbiome, independent of dog                 breed or sex. Diet responses were in agreement with those                 observed in previous human studies, leading to the conclusion                 that findings in dogs may be predictive of human microbiome                 results. In particular, a novel finding is that overweight or                 obese dogs experience larger compositional shifts than lean                 dogs in response to a high protein diet.	24	2941384	741228768	316292652	2018-03-01 08:04:39	126	0	126	0	no applicable		no applicable							Canis lupus familiaris																microbial																																																																																															6																																																				Gut fecal	not applicable																																																																																																																																																																												not applicable	not applicable	not applicable																																																																				1																																																																																																			BASE																												46.4	LAB	OW		male	1

Microorganisms from all three domains of life establish associations with plants. Although some harm the plant as pathogens, others antagonize pathogens or help the plant though priming of the plant immune system, nutrient acquisition, tuning plant hormone levels, and more. Most culture-independent plant microbiome research has focused on amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and/or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), but the decreasing price of high-throughput sequencing has made shotgun metagenome sequencing increasingly accessible. Here, we describe the shotgun sequencing of 275 wild Arabidopsis thaliana leaf microbiomes from southwest Germany, with additional 16S and ITS1 amplicon data for 176 of those samples. The samples were dominated by bacteria, with eukaryotes contributing a minority of reads. Microbial membership showed weak associations with both site of origin and plant genotype, which were highly confounded. There is large variation among microbiomes, with one extreme comprising samples of low complexity and a high load of microorganisms typical of infected plants, and samples of high complexity and a low microbial load as the other extreme. We use the metagenome data, which captures the ratio of plant to bacterial DNA in real leaves, to scale the 16S amplicon data such that they reflect absolute bacterial abundance, and show that this cost effective hybrid strategy overcomes compositionality problems in amplicon data and leads to fundamentally different conclusions about microbiome assembly.	1	2421184	722370048	337093856	2019-05-02 08:26:33	149.28	4.85	149.07	6.18																			2019-04-30	2019-03-05	SAMEA5393720	MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY	MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY	2019-04-30T04:02:48Z	2019-03-05T08:58:42Z	public	NextMet82_740	thale cress	NextMet82_740

Exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with a higher risk of developing Crohn's disease but is inversely correlated with the development, disease risks, progression, and relapse rate of ulcerative colitis. Few mechanistic studies have investigated the effect of cigarette smoke on intestinal inflammation and microbial composition.MethodsThree groups of mice were exposed to three different concentrations of cigarette smoke for a total of four weeks, including five days of dextran sulfate sodium treatment to induce colitis and a seven-day recovery period. A comprehensive and integrated comparative analysis of the global colon transcriptome and microbiome, as well as classical endpoints, was performed.ResultsCigarette smoke exposure significantly decreased the severity of induced colitis. Colon transcriptome analysis revealed that cigarette smoke downregulated specific pathways in a concentration-dependent manner, affecting both the inflammatory state and composition of the gut microbiome. Metagenomics analysis demonstrated that cigarette smoke can modulate dextran sulfate sodium-induced dysbiosis of specific bacterial genera, contributing to resolve the inflammation or accelerate recovery.	1	19677824	5942702848	2455512048	2020-06-06 15:15:49	151	0	151	0																																								2020-06-05	2020-01-27	SAMEA6504248	PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL R&D	PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL R&D	2020-06-05T04:05:45Z	2020-01-27T16:55:35Z	public	s057	s057					mouse gut metagenome			Singapore																						Control	2017-08-07	ENVO:01001406 laboratory facility	ENVO:01000922 animal cage	ENVO:00002003 fecal material	1.286202	103.783519		host-associated	metagenome	testing	Illumina																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				Sham
